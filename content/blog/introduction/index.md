Hello there and thanks for checking out this blog!
I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy creating it and that you'll learn a few new things.

## Why did I start doing this?

I've been struggling to find some good sources for interesting stuff related to _javascript_ and _react_ that I could read once in a few days but couldn't find one. 
Until recently I've found that [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) has been doing his own blog.
I've been reading it for some time now but although it's a great source of information and a sneak peek inside _react_ itself I think that beginners might find it a bit intimidating.
That's when I got the idea to create something similar but aimed more at people that are just starting with _javascript_ and/or _react_.

I really looking forward to making more content and diving into some interesting areas!

Till next time ðŸ‘‹.
