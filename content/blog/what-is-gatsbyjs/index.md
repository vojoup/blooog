While building this blog I was researching what to use for a static site. And since I'm a javascript guy and I listen to the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast I found out about [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
Gatsbyjs has been on ðŸ”¥ lately so I'd like to answer some of the questions I myself wondered about when first exposed to gatsbyjs.

## What is Gatsbyjs ?

> Blazing fast modern site generator for React
>
> <cite>Gatsby</cite>

In short, it's a static site generator that let's you use React and GraphQL.
Gatsby let's you use all the latest and greatest there is. Be it React, GraphQL, babel 7, you name it.

But that's not all.
It comes with tons of plugins such as [gatsby-plugin-sass](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/) that enables you to use sass,
[gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/?=remark) which parser markdown files and transforms them into html and many many more.

But one thing shines among the others.
The developer experience and their get started guide.
Even if you are someone who was never exposed to React, you're able to pick up Gatsby really fast in an incredibly comprehensive way.
And if you ever get lost their  doc is amazing!

# What makes it different?

For me, it's again the amount of plugins and the overall dev experience.

Besides that Gatsbys' unique usage of GraphQL makes it easy to both learn it and use it efficiently.

And there's another big reason. When you start a new Gatsby project using the _gatsby-cli_ you get a starter that's fully PWA enabled, fully accessible and the performance is off the charts!

# Is it for me if I don't know about React and/or GraphQL ?

As I've mentioned above, even if using Gatsby would be your first exposure to React and/or GraphQL you'll be able to make something.
It might take you a bit longer at the beginning but it'd be time well spend because at the end of the day you'll learn **3** new things at the same time!

# Where and how do I get started ?

The best place to get you started is definitely [Gatsbys' get started docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
Just go through the tutorial there and they'll teach you the basics.

After completing that explore the [starters section](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/#starters) and try to recreate some of them.

I hope that you liked this blog post and that Gatsby will get some of your attention as well.
I'll be making more post about Gatsby in the future so you better stay tunned in!

Till next time ðŸ‘‹.
