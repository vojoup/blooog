While building this blog I was researching what to use for a static site. And since I'm a javascript guy and I listen to the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast I found out about [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
Gatsbyjs has been on ðŸ”¥ lately so I'd like to answer some of the questions I myself wondered about when first exposed to gatsbyjs.

## What is Gatsbyjs ?

In short, it is a static site generator that let's you use React.
But that's not all.
It comes with tons of plugins like [remark transformer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) which takes your markdown files and transforms them into html which I use for this blog.

# What makes it different?

# Is it for me if I don't know about React and/or GraphQL ?

# Where and how do I get started ?

Till next time ðŸ‘‹.
